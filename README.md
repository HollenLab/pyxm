pyxm is a task management system for scanning tunneling, scanning probe, or atomic force microscopes written in Python 3.11, with the PySide6 GUI library.
It aims to provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to queue up multiple sets of images and spectroscopy tasks to preform in a user-defined order.
TCP/IP commands can be customized through a JSON file to fit the needs of any system.
pyxm is designed to communicate with an already existing STM controller and cannot control an STM directly.

**⚠️ pyxm is currently in an experimental stage and only been tested on the RHK PanScan Freedom system. ⚠️**

## Features

- [x] Connect to an STM device using TCP/IP sockets
- [x] Fine-tuned control of STM parameters with easy-to-use input fields.
- [x] Simultaneous execution and creation of tasks allowing for versatile experimentation and efficient workflow management.
- [x] Preview images from a task inside scan area.
- [x] Customize TCP/IP commands to accomodate syntax used by the users STM controller.
- [ ] Save task sets for reuse or documentation.

## Installation
The latest release of pyxm can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/bhc1010/pyxm/releases) section.

## Build from source

1. Clone the repository:
```console
git clone https://github.com/bhc1010/sam9000
```

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
```console
cd pyxm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run pyxm:
```console
python src/main.py
```

## Custom STM commands
Commands required to interact with your STM controller can be specified in the 'stm_commands.json' file.

_Example of `stm_commands.json` for the RHK PanScanFreedom via the R9_

```json
{
  "set_bias": "SetSWParameter, STM Bias, Value",
  "set_setpoint": "SetSWParameter, STM Set Point, Value",
  "set_scansize": "SetSWParameter, Scan Area Window, Scan Area Size",
  "set_xoffset":   "SetSWParameter, Scan Area Window, X Offset",
  "set_yoffset":   "SetSWParameter, Scan Area Window, Y Offset"
  "etc": "..."
}
```
